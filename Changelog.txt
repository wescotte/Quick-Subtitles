2015/04/03 Version 1.02 Released
			Fixed compatibility issues with Firefox/Mozilla
				Mozilla handles events for mouse slightly different than other browsers so had to tweak function dragWaveform(event)
					Also updated init() to correct dispatch mouse clicks when loading videos and loading subtitles
				Changed instances of innerText to innerHTML
				Added <meta> tag in <header> to identify the proper character set used.
				TODO: Some of the hotkeys don't work in Firefox/Mozilla as they have other default functionality.
					Since nobody has reported an issue to me I'm going to be lazy and not fix them now...
					
			Created global WAVEFORM_FRAMERATE which is the number of MS to wait before drawing a new waveform preview
					1000/20 = 50ms or 20 frames per second.
					

2014/11/15 Version 1.01 Released
			Switched hotkeys again... I think this finally should work effectively cross platform/browser
				CTRL/ALT and SHIFT+CTRL/ALT set/clear IN/OUT points
				SHIFT + WINDOWS/COMMAND + UP/DOWN instead of ALT + WINDOWS/COMMAND + UP/DOWN
				Removed CTRL + +/- shortcut to adjust speed. Now only +/- on numeric keypad

2014/11/01 Version 1.0 Released
			Ensured list of subtitles stay in chronological as before new subtitles were just inserted at the end
			Added undo/redo functionality 
			Added PAL support for STL export
			Added buttons for setting/clearing IN/OUT points and adding subtitles.
			When you shift a subtitle it now "sticks" to a neighboring subtitle when they touch/overlap
				If you keep shifting short subtitles can pass through/jump others.
			Modified Hotkeys -- See instructions for entire list
			Cleaned up UI
			Refactored all HTML onchange/onclick code to use event listeners in init() function.	
			Lots of tiny little bug fixes on edge cases.

2014/10/04 Version 0.94 Released
			Fixed bug in updateID()
				Forgot to update SHIFT and SPLIT id tags so after splitting or deleting a row it could get out of sync and the
				buttons would perform actions on the wrong rows.

2014/10/03 Version 0.93 Released
			Added waveform preview
			Added ability to scrub video via waveform
			Modified UI to better accommodate a waveform preview
			Added processKeyboardInputKeyUp(event) function to enable SHIFT/ALT keys to work with "Shift Sub" to isolate IN or OUT points only

2014/09/22
			Added "Split Sub" functionality which breaks a subtitle into two new subtitles each half the length of the original
			Added "Shift Sub" functionality which allows the user to shift a subtitle +/- 1.5 seconds in 25ms increments.
			Added setTimecodeNative(type, row, newValue) function
			Refactor: 
				Created function updateIDs() which was code taken from deleteSubs() because this code is also needed by "Split Sub"
				Dropped function processOtherKeystrokes() and instead moved functionality to added a "input" handler on "SUB0" 
				Dropped function function updateTimecodeValue(node, newValue) because function setTimecode(type, row, newValue) did the same thing
				function addSub() modified to addSub(insertAfter) to reuse code for "Split Sub" functionality
					Only change was instead of allows adding to the end you can add to the table after row
					
2014/09/18 Version 0.92 Released
			Added "Arrow Keys" functionality. Toggle by SHIFT + SPACEBAR
				When "Off" Arrow keys function as normal on the active element. For example in a <textarea> you can navigate the cursor.
				When "On" those behaviors are being overwritten by so that LEFT and RIGHT arrows go previous/next subtitles
					UP/DOWN arrows adjust IN and OUT points based on playhead.
				NOTE: When "Off" you can still use the arrow keys but you have to click outside the main window so no buttons/inputs are active
			
			Modified: Help screen layout
			
			I should probably just start using GIT already...
			Modified: loadSRTFile() 
				Fixed a bug where files with carriage returns + newlines weren't being loaded properly.
			
			Refactor: Globals to use better naming convention of UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
				currentRow ->  CURRENT_ROW  & lastBox -> LAST_BOX & displayingSubOutPoint -> DISPLAYING_SUB_OUT_POINT
			
			Modified: deleteSubs() 
				--Allowed it to exit early if you don't actually delete anything
				--If any subtitles were actually deleted call resetDisplayedSubtitle() in case the sub currently being displayed no longer exists.
				--Fixed bug where the subtitle count was off by one after deletion.
					replaced: CURRENT_ROW=table.rows.length;
					with: CURRENT_ROW=table.rows.length + 1; 
					removed: 
							if (CURRENT_ROW == 0)	
								CURRENT_ROW=1;
	
				
2014/09/15 - Version 0.91 Released
			Modified: SaveSRTFile() to prompt user for filename
			Added: Functionality to export to STL file (NTSC only right now)
			Added: Functionality to change subtitle preview text color, background color, font size, and opacity
			Modified: Misc cleanup changing several <input type="button"> to <button>
			Modified: Slightly altered the behavior of TAB and ENTER so they only function when IN0, OUT0, or SUB0 is active.
			Modified UI - Right side added a bit more vertical space for "Status Messages"
			
2014/09/09 - Version 0.90 Released
