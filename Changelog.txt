2014/10/20 Version 0.95 Released
			Ensured list of subtitles stay in chronological as before new subtitles were just inserted at the end
			Modified arrow key functionality to require modifier keys this way “Enable Arrows” can be on by default
				and doesn’t interfere with normal usage nearly as much.
			Added undo/redo functionality 
			Added PAL support for STL export
			Added buttons for setting/clearing IN/OUT points and adding subtitles.
			Modified Hotkeys -- See instructions for entire list
			Cleaned up UI
			Refactored all HTML onchange/onclick code to use event listeners in init() function.	
		

2014/10/04 Version 0.94 Released
			Fixed bug in updateID()
				Forgot to update SHIFT and SPLIT id tags so after splitting or deleting a row it could get out of sync and the
				buttons would perform actions on the wrong rows.

2014/10/03 Version 0.93 Released
			Added waveform preview
			Added ability to scrub video via waveform
			Modified UI to better accommodate a waveform preview
			Added processKeyboardInputKeyUp(event) function to enable SHIFT/ALT keys to work with "Shift Sub" to isolate IN or OUT points only

2014/09/22
			Added "Split Sub" functionality which breaks a subtitle into two new subtitles each half the length of the original
			Added "Shift Sub" functionality which allows the user to shift a subtitle +/- 1.5 seconds in 25ms increments.
			Added setTimecodeNative(type, row, newValue) function
			Refactor: 
				Created function updateIDs() which was code taken from deleteSubs() because this code is also needed by "Split Sub"
				Dropped function processOtherKeystrokes() and instead moved functionality to added a "input" handler on "SUB0" 
				Dropped function function updateTimecodeValue(node, newValue) because function setTimecode(type, row, newValue) did the same thing
				function addSub() modified to addSub(insertAfter) to reuse code for "Split Sub" functionality
					Only change was instead of allows adding to the end you can add to the table after row
					
2014/09/18 Version 0.92 Released
			Added "Arrow Keys" functionality. Toggle by SHIFT + SPACEBAR
				When "Off" Arrow keys function as normal on the active element. For example in a <textarea> you can navigate the cursor.
				When "On" those behaviors are being overwritten by so that LEFT and RIGHT arrows go previous/next subtitles
					UP/DOWN arrows adjust IN and OUT points based on playhead.
				NOTE: When "Off" you can still use the arrow keys but you have to click outside the main window so no buttons/inputs are active
			
			Modified: Help screen layout
			
			I should probably just start using GIT already...
			Modified: loadSRTFile() 
				Fixed a bug where files with carriage returns + newlines weren't being loaded properly.
			
			Refactor: Globals to use better naming convention of UPPER_CASE_WITH_UNDERSCORES
				currentRow ->  CURRENT_ROW  & lastBox -> LAST_BOX & displayingSubOutPoint -> DISPLAYING_SUB_OUT_POINT
			
			Modified: deleteSubs() 
				--Allowed it to exit early if you don't actually delete anything
				--If any subtitles were actually deleted call resetDisplayedSubtitle() in case the sub currently being displayed no longer exists.
				--Fixed bug where the subtitle count was off by one after deletion.
					replaced: CURRENT_ROW=table.rows.length;
					with: CURRENT_ROW=table.rows.length + 1; 
					removed: 
							if (CURRENT_ROW == 0)	
								CURRENT_ROW=1;
